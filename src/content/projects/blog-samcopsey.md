A statically generated personal blog and portfolio, built entirely in public. Content is authored in Markdown using Astro's content collections — typed schemas enforce consistent frontmatter across blog posts and project writeups.

Interactive features (theme toggle, content filtering) use React islands so the rest of the site ships zero JavaScript. The full source, deployment workflow, and content are available on GitHub.
