      <p>
        Hi, I'm Sam Copsey — an Engineering &amp; Innovation Manager based in the UK.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blog is where I write about the things I spend my time thinking about at work: building
        AI agents in the Microsoft ecosystem, leading engineering teams through a period of rapid
        change, and making sure AI solutions are deployed responsibly with UK data residency and
        sovereignty requirements in mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work primarily in the Microsoft stack — Copilot Studio, Azure AI, Power Platform — and
        I'm especially interested in how organisations can move from experimental AI projects to
        production systems that people actually rely on.
      </p>

      <p>The three pillars of this blog:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Agent Building</strong> — Practical guides on building and shipping AI agents using
          Microsoft tools, with a focus on real-world patterns that work in enterprise settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Engineering Leadership</strong> — How to lead technical teams in the AI era, from
          hiring and culture to making sound architectural decisions under uncertainty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sovereign AI on Azure</strong> — Building AI solutions that meet UK data residency
          requirements, particularly for public sector and regulated industries.
        </li>
      </ul>
